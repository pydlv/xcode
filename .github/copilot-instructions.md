- When building project, use the linux-specific build task to speed up development. Avoid `./gradlew build` which would build for all platforms.
- If you want to quickly run tests, then use the Gradle `nativeLinuxTest` task.
- Before checking in code, run Qodana code quality analysis using the `.github/run-qodana-scan.sh` script to address any code quality issues.
- Update relevant project documentation after completing a PR. 
- If you are unable to complete the requested work entirely, then be sure to clearly communicate the remaining items to the user.
